This is another masterpiece brought to you by the Y.A development team™ ©.

This is an implementation for the server-side of the best-to-be website
on the entire internet (including the darknet) - a recipes website.
the servers side uses the spoonacular API.

On the server-side there are 3 routes:
1. Recipe - get a recipe/recipes from spoonacular API or the server-side DataBase by a given recipe ID or by a given query inserted by the user or guest on the website.
2. Profile - let logged in users create a recipe, add recipe to their favorites,
	view his favorite recipes and view his uploaded recipes.
3. User - let users log in to their user account,
	let guests register to the website, and let users to logout
	from the website.

In addition, our server-side supports:
 -  Showing 3 random recipes from the spoonacular API at the home page.
 -	View the developer's family recipes.
